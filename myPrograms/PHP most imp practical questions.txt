common question types, categorized for clarity:

I. PHP Basics & Syntax
These questions test your understanding of the core language elements.


Variables and Data Types:

Question: Declare various types of variables (integer, float, string, boolean, array, object, NULL) and print their values and data types using var_dump().

Question: Demonstrate the difference between == (loose comparison) and === (strict comparison).

Question: Explain and demonstrate the use of superglobal variables ($_GET, $_POST, $_REQUEST, $_SERVER, $_SESSION, $_COOKIE, $_FILES).


Operators:

Question: Write a script to demonstrate arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical, increment/decrement, and string concatenation operators.

Question: Explain the difference between . and + for string operations.


Control Structures:

Question: Implement a program using if-else if-else to check if a number is positive, negative, or zero.

Question: Use a switch statement to display the day of the week based on a number (1-7).

Question: Write programs using for, while, do-while, and foreach loops to print patterns or iterate through arrays.

Question: Demonstrate the use of break and continue statements within loops.


Functions:

Question: Create a user-defined function that takes parameters and returns a value (e.g., calculate factorial, check prime number).

Question: Explain the difference between include, require, include_once, and require_once. Provide a scenario where require_once is crucial.

Question: Demonstrate the use of common built-in string functions (e.g., strlen(), strpos(), substr(), str_replace(), trim(), strtoupper(), strtolower()).

Question: Demonstrate the use of common built-in array functions (e.g., count(), array_push(), array_pop(), sort(), asort(), ksort(), in_array(), array_keys(), array_values()).



II. Array Manipulation
Arrays are fundamental in PHP. Expect questions that require you to manipulate them.


Indexed and Associative Arrays:

Question: Create and display an indexed array.

Question: Create and display an associative array (e.g., storing student names and their marks).

Question: Access and modify elements in both types of arrays.

Question: Iterate through indexed and associative arrays using for and foreach loops.


Multidimensional Arrays:

Question: Create and display a simple two-dimensional array (e.g., a matrix or a list of students with multiple subjects).

Question: Access specific elements in a multidimensional array.


Array Functions:

Question: Sort an array in ascending/descending order (numeric and associative).

Question: Add/remove elements from the beginning/end of an array.

Question: Search for a specific value or key in an array.



III. Form Handling and Validation
This is a crucial part of web development.


HTML Form Creation:

Question: Create an HTML form with various input types (text, password, radio, checkbox, select, textarea, submit).


PHP Form Processing:

Question: Write a PHP script to process data submitted via GET and POST methods. Explain the difference between GET and POST.

Question: Display the submitted form data on the same page or a separate page.


Form Validation:

Question: Implement server-side validation for form fields (e.g., check if fields are empty, validate email format, validate numeric input, check password strength).

Question: Display error messages next to the respective fields if validation fails, while preserving valid input.

Question: Use htmlspecialchars() to prevent XSS attacks when displaying user input.



IV. Database Interaction (MySQL/MariaDB with MySQLi or PDO)
This is often the most significant part of practical exams. You'll likely need a local server (XAMPP/WAMP/LAMP).


Database Connection:

Question: Write PHP code to connect to a MySQL/MariaDB database (using MySQLi procedural/OOP or PDO). Handle connection errors.



CRUD Operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete):


Question:

Create: Insert data from an HTML form into a database table.

Read: Fetch and display all records from a table in an HTML table format.

Update: Implement functionality to update an existing record based on its ID.

Delete: Implement functionality to delete a record based on its ID.

Question: Use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection when inserting or updating data.


Error Handling for Database Operations:

Question: Demonstrate how to catch and display database errors.



V. Session and Cookie Management
These are essential for maintaining state in web applications.


Sessions:

Question: Implement a simple login/logout system using PHP sessions.

Question: Store and retrieve user-specific data in session variables across multiple pages.

Question: Destroy a session upon logout.


Cookies:

Question: Set and retrieve cookies to remember user preferences (e.g., "Remember Me" checkbox for username).

Question: Set a cookie with an expiration time.

Question: Delete a cookie.

Question: Explain the difference between sessions and cookies, and when to use each.



VI. File Handling
Basic file operations are often included.


Reading and Writing Files:

Question: Read the content of a text file and display it.

Question: Write content to a text file (append or overwrite).

Question: Read line by line from a file using fgets().


File Uploads:

Question: Create an HTML form for file upload.

Question: Write a PHP script to handle file uploads, including validation for file type and size, and moving the uploaded file to a specific directory.



VII. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in PHP
Universities often introduce basic OOP concepts.


Classes and Objects:

Question: Define a class with properties and methods. Create objects from the class and access their properties/methods.

Question: Implement constructors and destructors (__construct(), __destruct()).


Encapsulation:

Question: Demonstrate public, private, and protected access modifiers.


Inheritance:

Question: Create a parent class and a child class that extends it, demonstrating method overriding.


Static Members:

Question: Use static properties and methods.



VIII. Practical Application / Mini-Projects
Often, you'll be asked to combine multiple concepts into a small application.

Basic CRUD Application: Develop a simple application (e.g., student registration, product list) that allows users to add, view, edit, and delete records from a database.

User Authentication: Implement a login/registration system with password hashing (password_hash(), password_verify()).

Simple Calculator: Create an HTML form for a calculator and process the operations using PHP.

Dynamic Web Page: Create a page that displays content fetched from a database or a file.



Tips for Preparation:
Hands-on Practice: The most important thing is to code. Don't just read about it.

Understand Error Messages: Learn to debug by understanding common PHP error messages.

Security: Pay attention to security aspects like SQL injection prevention and XSS.

Structure Your Code: Use comments, proper indentation, and clear variable names.

Local Server Setup: Ensure your XAMPP/WAMP/LAMP stack is correctly installed and configured.

Review PHP Manual: The official PHP manual is an excellent resource for function syntax and examples.
