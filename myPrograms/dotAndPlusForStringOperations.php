<!-- In PHP, both . and + can be used in the context of string operations, but they serve fundamentally different purposes and behave distinctly.

Here's a breakdown of the difference:

. (Dot) - String Concatenation Operator
The . (dot) is the string concatenation operator in PHP. Its sole purpose is to join two or more strings together to form a single, longer string.

How it works:

It takes two operands (which can be strings, numbers, or other data types that PHP can convert to strings).

It combines them in the order they appear.

The result is always a string. -->


<!-- Key Characteristics of '.' :

Explicit String Operation: It's designed specifically for string manipulation.

Type Juggling for Non-Strings: If you concatenate a non-string value (like a number or boolean) with a string, PHP will automatically convert the non-string value to its string representation before performing the concatenation.

No Arithmetic Operation: It never performs arithmetic addition. -->

<?php

    $fName = "Abhisek";
    $lName = "Kumar";
    $age = 30;

    echo "Your name is : " . $fName . " " . $lName;
    echo "Your age is : " . $age;

    echo $fName . $lName . $age;

?>


<!-- '+' (Plus) - Arithmetic Addition Operator
The + (plus) is the arithmetic addition operator in PHP. Its primary function is to perform mathematical addition on numerical values.

How it works:

It takes two operands.

It attempts to convert both operands to numerical types (integers or floats) before performing the addition.

The result is typically a number (integer or float). -->

<?php

    $num1 = 5;
    $num2 = 10;
    $sum = $num1 + $num2; // Performs arithmetic addition
    echo $sum; // Output: 15

    $price = 19.99;
    $tax = 2.50;
    $total = $price + $tax;
    echo $total; // Output: 22.49

?>

<!-- How + behaves with strings (and why it's usually not what you want for string operations):

When + encounters strings, it tries its best to convert them into numbers to perform arithmetic. This can lead to unexpected results if you're trying to use it for string concatenation.

Numeric Strings: If the strings are valid numeric strings, they will be converted to numbers and added. -->

<?php

    $strNum1 = "5";
    $strNum2 = "10";
    $result = $strNum1 + $strNum2; // "5" becomes 5, "10" becomes 10, then added
    echo $result; // Output: 15 (a number)

?>

<!-- Non-Numeric Strings: If the strings are not valid numeric strings (or contain non-numeric characters at the beginning), they will be treated as 0 in a numeric context. -->

<?php

    $stringA = "Hello";
    $stringB = "World";
    $result = $stringA + $stringB; // "Hello" becomes 0, "World" becomes 0, then added
    echo $result; // Output: 0

    $stringC = "10abc";
    $stringD = "def5";
    $result = $stringC + $stringD; // "10abc" becomes 10, "def5" becomes 0, then added
    echo $result; // Output: 10

?>

<!-- Key Characteristics of +:

Arithmetic Operation: Primarily for mathematical addition.

Type Juggling for Numbers: It attempts to convert operands to numbers. -->

<!-- Warning/Notice Potential: Depending on the PHP version and error reporting settings, trying to add non-numeric strings might trigger warnings or notices, especially in older PHP versions or with strict error reporting. -->

Feature	                                . (Dot) - Concatenation Operator	        + (Plus) - Arithmetic Operator

Purpose	                                Joins strings together	                    Performs mathematical addition
Result Type	                            Always a string	                            Typically a number (int/float)
String Handling	                        Treats operands as strings	                Attempts to convert operands to numbers
Non-String Handling	                    Converts to string representation	        Converts to numeric representation (0 for non-numeric)
